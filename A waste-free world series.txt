A waste-free world series 

I. The fundamentals

In nature, nothing goes to waste. What is waste for one, is food for another. This goes on and on, as long as there is life on earth. Thatâ€™s the fundamental process which nature has found to make use of limited resources for an unlimited amount of time. A cyclical system that can grow and adapt forever.
