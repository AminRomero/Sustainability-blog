                <h1>Is a waste-free world possible?</h1>
                <h2>I. Introduction</h2>
                <h3>It has been done before</h3>
                <p>In nature, nothing goes to waste. What is waste for one, is food for another. This goes on and on, as long as there is life on earth. That’s the fundamental process which nature has found to make use of limited resources for an unlimited amount of time. A cyclical system that can grow and adapt forever.</p>
                <p>This is the basic principle we now hold as the gold standard for a truly sustainable economy. However, this is not the world we live in yet. We make things we don’t need, from materials we can’t later recover, and we just bury it all. As we do this, we damage the air we breathe, the water we drink and the soil that grows our food.</p> 
    
                <p>Atmospheric chemist Paul J. Crutzen and diatom researcher Eugene F. Stoermer say we are living now in what they call the Anthropocene, a new geological epoch in which we have fundamentally altered the physical, chemical and biological systems of the planet.</p> 
                <p>What are those changes? Well, besides habiting almost every corner on the planet and some pretty awesome buildings, that also involves human-made massive extinctions, habitat destruction, wide scale natural resource extraction, ocean acidification, immoderate greenhouse gases emissions, and climate change.</p>
                <p>But there is no need for despair, there is much that can be done with today's technology, resources and knowledge. In these series, we will explore how we can start implementing a truly sustainable, waste-free world.

                <p>"At its core, sustainability relates to the basic human need to maintain and to nurture the conditions on which life depends."
