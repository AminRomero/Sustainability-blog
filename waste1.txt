A waste-free world series 

I. The fundamentals

In nature, nothing goes to waste. What is waste for one, is food for another. This goes on and on, as long as there is life on earth. That’s the fundamental process which nature has found to make use of limited resources for an unlimited amount of time. A cyclical system that can grow and adapt forever. 

This is the basic principle we now hold as the gold standard for a truly sustainable economy (Some might say, the only way we can survive in the long run).

However, this is not the world we live in yet. We make things we don’t need, from materials we can’t later recover, and we just bury it all. As we do this, we damage the air we breathe, the water we drink and the soil that grows our food. Even for the folks that couldn’t care less about ‘the environment’ or penguins in the Antarctic, it’s still going to blow up in our faces sooner or later.
